                        It’s notoriously difficult to take a picture of a black hole. But when they are surrounded by material we have an opportunity to witness the hole carved out by the event horizon. But what we see in the famous images of black holes isn’t the event horizon
                        itself, but a magnified and enlarged version known as the shadow.
                        <br> No light can escape the surface of a black hole, a boundary which is known as the event horizon. Because of that simple fact black holes make for frustratingly difficult astronomical targets. They emit no radiation of their
                        own (except for the possibility of the exotic quantum process known as Hawking radiation, but that is far too feeble to be meaningful).</p>
                    <p class="more-text" style="display:none">
                        <br> Plus, they don’t reflect or refract any surrounding light, so we can only detect them based on their influence on their surroundings. The most common way to do this is to search for accretion discs, which are rings of material
                        surrounding a black hole consisting of matter flowing into the event horizon. As the matter approaches the black hole, it heats up and glows with intense high energy radiation. We have been able to observe accretion discs around
                        black holes of all sizes, from stellar mass black holes in our galactic neighborhood to the supermassive black holes.

                        <br> We’ve also been able to observe the gravitational waves emitted when black holes , merge together and watch as stars orbit around central, unseen centers of gravity.
                        <br> But starting a few years ago the Event Horizon Telescope has been able to provide a new view of black holes by directly imaging the of two supermassive black holes, one in the Virgo galaxy and one in our own. The images show
                        a ghostly glow surrounding a void of complete nothingness.
                        <br> That void of complete nothingness is indeed the black hole, but the black hole itself is far smaller than the hole suggests. What we are actually observing in the gap in the images is known as the shadow. The shadow itself
                        is caused by two things.
